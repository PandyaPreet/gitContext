# Changelog

All notable changes to Git Context are documented here. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and the project uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [0.1.4] - 2026-10-07

### Fixed

- On macOS, switching profiles with the Command+Shift+G quick switcher no longer brings the main Git Context window to the front. When the shortcut is used from another app, the main window stays hidden while the picker is open, and focus returns to the previous app after a profile is selected or the picker is dismissed. The main window reappears unchanged when you return to Git Context.
- **Check for updates** retries once and waits longer before reporting a failure, so a dropped connection or slow network no longer shows an error straight away. Background checks at launch and once a day no longer show an error when the computer is offline.
- Update errors now explain what to do (no connection, the app running from a disk image or read-only location, a declined administrator prompt, a download that failed verification) and keep the original error text for bug reports.

### Added

- **Restart now** appears after an update is installed. On macOS, Cmd+Q and Dock Quit only hide the app, so the old version previously kept running until a full quit from the menu bar.
- **Download manually** opens the latest release page whenever a check or installation fails.
- Download progress is shown while an update downloads.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-10-02

### Fixed

- Grant the main window the resource-close permission required by the updater.
- Keep successful installations successful even if resource cleanup fails; handle cleanup failures during checks and window teardown without unhandled rejections.
- Preserve the restart notice after installation instead of checking again from the old running version. Clarify that restarting requires the tray/menu-bar full-exit action.

### Changed

- On macOS, Dock Quit, application-menu Quit, and Cmd+Q hide the app windows while keeping the menu-bar profile switcher running.
- The tray exit action is labelled **Quit Git Context Completely** to distinguish a full exit from hiding the windows. Explicit application exits and updater restarts remain allowed.
- Dock/Finder reopening continues to restore the main window. Windows and Linux exit behaviour is unchanged; Force Quit still terminates the process.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-10-01

First published release with signed in-app updates.

### Fixed

- Release signing checks the private key, its password, and the public key before building, so a wrong password or mismatched key pair fails in seconds with a clear message instead of after a full build.
- Release signing trims pasted whitespace from the updater key secrets and password, and rejects malformed keys with a clear error.
- GitLab SSH verification recognizes greetings with different capitalization, surrounding whitespace, and connection banners while still rejecting the wrong account.
- Verification checks for a missing private key before connecting and explains DNS, connection, host-key, and SSH-agent failures more clearly.

### Changed

- Explicit SSH verification now follows GitShift's first-use trust policy: OpenSSH records unknown host keys in `known_hosts` and rejects changed host keys. This trusts the first connection rather than independently validating a new fingerprint.
- Verification uses a fresh, isolated SSH connection with the selected profile key, custom host and port, a 15-second connection timeout, and a 30-second process limit.
- Signed in-app update distribution uses the repository's configured Tauri signing keys. Users of v0.1.1 and earlier must manually install this updater-enabled release once; future signed releases can be installed through **Check for updates**. Updater signatures are separate from OS code signing and notarization.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-09-30

### Added

- In-app SSH key generation: checks that the GitHub or GitLab username exists, creates an Ed25519 key with `ssh-keygen`, and links straight to the provider's SSH settings.
- Identity health check for missing keys, author/SSH conflicts and externally changed configuration, with **Reapply** for drift.
- **Verify active identity** for the global author, managed SSH configuration and key authentication.
- Quick switcher on `Cmd+Shift+G` / `Ctrl+Shift+G` that opens a compact picker without the main window.
- One-click profile activation, and profile colours shown in the sidebar, avatar and tray icon (plus the active profile name in the macOS menu bar).
- Groundwork for signed in-app updates. This release is not signed, so the app reports updates as not configured.

### Fixed

- SSH configuration validation on Windows, where OpenSSH could not read the staged config file.
- Release builds now fail loudly instead of finishing without attaching installers.

### Changed

- Update signing is optional in the release workflow; without signing keys, installers build as before.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-29

First public release.

### Added

- GitHub and GitLab profiles, including self-hosted hosts and custom SSH ports.
- Per-repository identity assignment: `user.name`, `user.email`, a managed SSH host alias and optional remote rewriting.
- Before/after preview of every change to SSH and Git configuration.
- A transaction journal with undo for each applied change.
- SSH identity verification against the provider.
- Automatic detection of Git, OpenSSH, existing SSH keys and hosts, the SSH agent and the GitHub CLI.
- A global default profile that can be switched from the system tray.
- A command palette (`⌘K` / `Ctrl K`).
- Launching a repository in VS Code, Terminal, iTerm, Windows Terminal, PowerShell, CMD or the file manager.
- Light and dark themes, launch at login, and a configurable startup view.
- Installers for macOS (Apple Silicon and Intel), Windows (x64 and ARM64) and Linux (x64 and ARM64).
